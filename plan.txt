* We need two classes one for Bread and one for Pastry
* We need a posibly contructor for orders
* Welcome message
* Shows cost of the Bread and Pastry 
* Each class has to have formula to prepare cost and make deals
* Bread class if statement, if user select 2 amount then 1 + free
* Pastry class if user select 2 pastry 3rd $1 discount
* Using list or dictionary?

//maybe a list to add all the items in the order 
//another list to see how many orders the user has

* Using dictionaries to save the key and value of classes

//if user said yes to buy more .add to the order
