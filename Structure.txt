Business Logic

* We need two classes one for Bread and one for Pastry
* We need a posibly contructor for orders
* Each class has to have formula to prepare cost and make deals
* Bread class if statement, if user select 2 amount then 1 + free
* Pastry class if user select 2 pastry 3rd $1 discount
* Using list or dictionary?

//Bread class
kind of Bread
price

method for specials bread

//Pastry class
kind of pastry
price

method for specials pastry

//maybe a list to add all the items in the MENU
//maybe dictionary to add different orders
//maybe with dictionaries can use the key that holds all the breads or pastry 
info and value will be what the user number hits to select its key

* Using dictionaries to save the key and value of classes

//list that hold the breads and pastry on the MENU
//GetDiscount when user has more than 2 breads
